### Uniik Rock Paper Scissors Game

I built this game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a depiction of the widely known rock-paper-scissors game.

#### Project Description

The Uniik Rock Paper Scissors Game is a classic implementation of the timeless hand game "Rock, Paper, Scissors," brought to life through modern web technologies. Developed using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, this project serves as a fun and educational exercise in front-end development.

**Features and Highlights:**
- **Intuitive User Interface:** The game features a clean and simple interface, making it easy for users to play and enjoy.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players can select their move (rock, paper, or scissors) with a single click, and the game logic determines the outcome instantly.
- **Responsive Design:** The game is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** Visual and textual feedback is provided to indicate the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the result of each round.

**Technical Aspects:**
- **HTML:** The structure of the game is built with semantic HTML, ensuring accessibility and easy maintenance.
- **CSS:** Custom styles are applied to create an engaging and visually appealing interface. CSS transitions are used to enhance the user experience.
- **JavaScript:** The core logic of the game is implemented in JavaScript. This includes generating random moves for the computer, comparing the player's and computer's moves to determine the winner, and updating the game state.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- **DOM Manipulation:** Gained proficiency in manipulating the DOM to update the game state and reflect changes in real-time.
- **Event Handling:** Improved skills in handling user interactions through JavaScript event listeners.
- **Conditional Logic:** Enhanced understanding of conditional statements and their application in game logic.

The Uniik Rock Paper Scissors Game not only demonstrates my ability to build interactive web applications but also showcases my dedication to creating engaging user experiences. This project reflects my passion for coding and my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
